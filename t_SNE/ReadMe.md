This is the very simple implementation of t-SNE algorithm using sklearn, pandas and matplotlib.

t-SNE is very important for 2D visualization of unlabelled data. It is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that is particularly well-suited for embedding high-dimensional data into a space of two or three dimensions, which can then be visualized in a scatter plot.

A simple implementation on unlabelled Iris dataset looks like this:
