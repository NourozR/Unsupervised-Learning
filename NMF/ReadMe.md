# NMF:
Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF or NNMF), also non-negative matrix approximation is a group of algorithms in multivariate analysis and linear algebra where a matrix V is factorized into (usually) two matrices W and H, with the property that all three matrices have no negative elements. This non-negativity makes the resulting matrices easier to inspect. Since the problem is not exactly solvable in general, it is commonly approximated numerically. Particularly, this algorithm is used for unsupervised learning/knowledge learning/clustering.

In this example, based on words on wiki articles, clustering has been done. This dataset is simple but very intuitive.
